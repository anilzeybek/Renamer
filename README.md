# Renamer

Sort and rename all the files in current directory with custom header and with numbers after the header.

This code only works with current directory for now.

## Getting Started

```console
foo@bar:~$ python3 renamer.py
DONE!
```

Or if you want with header:
```console
foo@bar:~$ python3 renamer.py -n "CUSTOM_HEADER"
DONE!
```

### Prerequisites

Python with version 3 is enough!
